    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work: it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once via external stylesheets (stored as CSS files).  CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
    <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page: It was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br/><br/>
      <code>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code><br/><br/>
      
      When tags like "font" and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS, thus removing the need for style formatting from the HTML itself. </p>

    <header>Syntax</header>
    <p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.  The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.  The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.  Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
    <p>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.  An example would be:<br/><br/>
      <code>
        p {color: red; text-align: center;}
      </code>
    
    </p>

    <header>Using CSS</header>
    <p>When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.  There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</p>
    <li>- External Style Sheet</li>
    <li>- Internal Style Sheet</li>
    <li>- Inline Style</li>
    <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!  Each page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element. The link element goes inside the head section, like so:<br/><br/>
      <code>
        &lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
      </code><br/><br/>
      
      An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file should not contain any html tags. The style sheet file must be saved with a .css extension.</p>
    <p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single page has a unique style.  Internal styles are defined within the style element, inside the head section of an HTML page:</p><br/>
    <code>
       &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;style&gt;
body {
    background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
    color: maroon;
    margin-left: 40px;
}
 &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt; 
    </code>
    
    <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.  To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p><br/>
    <code>
       &lt;h1&gt; style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    </code>
    <p>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?  Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:</p>
    <li>- Inline style (inside an HTML element)</li>
   <li>- External and internal style sheets (in the head section)</li>
   <li>- Browser default</li>

<p>So, an inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the head tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Colors">
    <header>Colors</header>
      <p>Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.</p>
      <p>In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name, such as Red, Green, DodgerBlue, LightGray, and so on.  HTML supports 140 standard color names.  You can set the background color, text color, and border color for HTML elements using CSS.</p>
      <p> An RGB value is generated using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue).  Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.  For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. </p>
      <p>A color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form #rrggbb, where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).  For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).</p>
      <p>Finally,  a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).  Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.  Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.  And lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white.

    <section class="main-section" id="Position">
    <header>Position</header>
      <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.  There are five different position values:</p>
    <li>- static</li>
    <li>-  relative</li>
    <li>-  fixed</li>
    <li>- absolute</li>
    <li>- sticky</li>
<p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.</p>
<p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.  Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.  An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</p>
<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.  Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.  A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>
<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).  However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
<p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.  A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>
<p>When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.  The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).   element can have a positive or negative stack order.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Specificity">
    <header>Specificity</header>
      <p>If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.  ink of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.  The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are highly specific! </p>
      <p>Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:</p>

      <li>Inline styles - An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled.</li>
      <li>IDs - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as #navbar.</li>
      <li>Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.</li>
      <li>Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after.</li>

<p>Memorize how to calculate specificity!  Start at 0, add 1000 for style attribute, add 100 for each ID, add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element.</p>
