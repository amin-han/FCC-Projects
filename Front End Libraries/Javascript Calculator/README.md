# Javascript Calculator

Basic calculator stylized to look like a handheld game console.  Will be updated to perform more complex evaluations in the future.  You can see it [here](https://codepen.io/minobino/pen/wJgMKd).

Please note that this relies on the Babel compiler being installed, which differs based on environment.  Please click [here](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation) for further information on how to get it going.
